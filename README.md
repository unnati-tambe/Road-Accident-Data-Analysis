# Road Accident Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation by using Power Bi)
## Project Objective
This project is to analyze and visualize road accident data to identify key trends, accident causes, high-risk areas, and casualty patterns by vehicle type, road type, and conditions. The goal is to support data-driven decisions for enhancing road safety and reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities.

## KPIs Requirements
•	Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth

•	Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth

•	Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year

•	Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year

•	Casualties by Road Type for Current year 

•	Casualties by Light Condition

•	Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night

•	Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Process
•  Data Collection: Gather road accident data from official sources including details like casualties, locations, vehicle types, and road conditions.

•  Data Cleaning & Preparation: Clean the data to remove errors, handle missing values, and standardize formats for accurate analysis by using power query editor.

•  Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and correlations (e.g., accidents by month, road type, vehicle).

•  Visualization Design: Choose key metrics (e.g., total casualties, accident severity, location density) and design visuals like charts, graphs, and maps using a Power BI tool.

•  Dashboard Development: Build the dashboard with filters (e.g., weather, road surface), interactive visuals (e.g., pie charts, heatmaps), and clear KPIs to make the data actionable.

## Project Insights

•	Total casualties decreased by 11.9%, with fatal casualties down 33.3%, indicating safety improvements.

•	Cars are the most involved in accidents, followed by vans and bikes.

•	Most accidents occur on single carriageways and during the daytime.

•	Urban areas account for over 60% of casualties.

•	Casualties peak in November and December, suggesting seasonal influence.


## Conclusion

The road accident analysis reveals critical patterns that can support improved road safety planning. While there has been a decline in both total casualties and fatal accidents, the majority of incidents still involve cars, occur on single carriageways, and are concentrated in urban areas. Daylight hours account for most accidents, and seasonal peaks—especially in late months—suggest environmental or behavioral trends. These findings provide valuable insights for targeted interventions, infrastructure upgrades, and policy development aimed at reducing road traffic incidents and saving lives.
